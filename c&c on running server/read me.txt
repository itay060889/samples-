Code that exploits bufferOverFlow in a server to open '/bin/sh' that can be control by the c&c
The OS is LINUX and assembly is x86
In this case to run the c&c we need to open server that listen on port 1337
(can be done by 'nc -l 1337' in the terminal)
Tech details
work on 14.04.1-Ubuntu
need to complile the server whitout canary protection
can be done by :gcc server.c -o server -fno-stack-protector
need to disable OS randomize to run program
can be done by : 
to disable
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
(to enable
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
or restart the OS)
